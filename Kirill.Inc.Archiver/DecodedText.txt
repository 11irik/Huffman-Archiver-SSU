e become a part of our lives many years ago. Watching TV, we learn a lot of information. The most important information coming from TV is certainly news.

Probably on the contrary - they only hamper our development, making us weak and inactive. Therefore, its impossible to say that TV is 100% boon.

So the idiot box" with TV shows, does it do more good or harm? Giving a clear answer is impossible. What will happen if we don't turn on TV at all? We wont be aware of what is going on in the world and in the country. You can, of course, learn the news through the Internet, but there arent many people who are used to doing so. Particularly its true for people over 50.
